# Introduction

Youâ€™re on a journey to find the ***Elixir of Immortality***. You find yourself in a strange forest, with towering trees that seem to whisper in a language you can't quite understand. The path ahead forks in three different directions. A signpost stands at the intersection, with the following options:

1. [Follow the path along the Duck River](path1-duckriver.md)
2. [Take the trail toward the Mysterious Cave](path2-cave.md)
3. [Walk through the Rainbow Meadow](path3-rainbow-meadow.md)
4. [Journey to the Evil Castle](path4-evilcastle.md)
