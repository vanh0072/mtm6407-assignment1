# **Uh oh - Dead End!**

You found that the river leads to a gang of mercenary ducks that you donâ€™t want to tussle with. You go back the way you came to choose a different path, and on your way, you notice a hidden door embedded in a tree with a portal inside. Which path do you take:

1. [Take the trail toward the Mysterious Cave](path2-cave.md)
2. [Walk through the Rainbow Meadow.](path3-rainbow.md)
3. [Journey to the Evil Castle](path4-evilcastle.md)
4. [Enter the hidden tree portal](path-portal.md)
