# Mysterious cave

After a long trek to the foot of the foot of the cave, your gut tells you to turn back. Instead of listening to your better judgment, you decide to venture inside. You walk and walk until the light of the outside world in completely gone. In the cold dark cave, you stumble upon a dungeon. But your excitement quickly turns to fear as you see a red dragon turn the corner. You are woefully unprepared to fight this beast. You lay down your sword and accept your fate as the dragon steps slowly towards you.
