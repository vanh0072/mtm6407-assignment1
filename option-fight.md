# Fight!
You decided to fight until your last breath. With every ounce of effort you can muster, you swing and slash at this monster. It is no use though. A dragon isnâ€™t the most feared creature in this world for no reason after all. The dragon endures your attacks until you are out of energy, and approaches to finish you off for good.
