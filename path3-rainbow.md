# Rainbow Meadow

You follow the path to the Rainbow Meadow. The forest opens into a field of glowing wildflowers under a shifting sky. Ahead, a glowing arch invites you forward, and rainbow-lit pools shimmer nearby.
But something feels wrong. Among the bright flowers, one is withering, its petals curling. The air grows still, as if the meadow is waiting for you.
